# MeetUp Clone

## Overview

This project is a basic clone of the site [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/), where users can create a profile, join groups, and rsvp to attend events. I am currently working on the back end.

I chose this project because I wanted to create a full stack app using Go on the back end and React on the front end.

It was also really important that I wrote tests for as many of the functions in the code as possible. Tests for all exported functions are under ` /test ` and tests for unexported functions can be found within their own packages.

Other tools/packages used so far include: <br>
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) <br>
[GORM](https://gorm.io/) <br>
[Authboss](https://github.com/volatiletech/authboss) <br>

An outline of user stories and wireframes can be found [here](https://github.com/zoe-gonzales/meet-up-do-stuff/tree/master/process).

The project KanBan can be found [here](https://github.com/zoe-gonzales/meet-up-do-stuff/projects/1).
