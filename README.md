# MeetUp Clone

## Overview

This project is a basic clone of the site [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/), where users can create a profile, join groups, and rsvp to attend events. It is in progress.

I chose this project because I wanted to create a full stack app using [Go](https://golang.org/) on the back end and [React](https://reactjs.org/) on the front end.

It was also really important to me that I wrote unit tests for as many of the functions in the code as possible. Tests for all exported functions are under ` /test ` and tests for unexported functions can be found within their own packages. I will soon be adding tests for the front end as well.

Other tools/packages used so far include: <br>
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) <br>
[GORM](https://gorm.io/) <br>
[Authboss](https://github.com/volatiletech/authboss) <br>
[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) <br>
[SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) <br>

An outline of user stories and wireframes can be found [here](https://github.com/zoe-gonzales/meet-up-do-stuff/tree/master/process).

The project KanBan can be found [here](https://github.com/zoe-gonzales/meet-up-do-stuff/projects/1).
